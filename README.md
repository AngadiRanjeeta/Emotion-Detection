# Emotion Detection from Facial Images

This repository contains the code for an emotion detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of facial images labeled with emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AngadiRanjeeta/Emotion-Detection.git
    cd Emotion-Detection
    ```

2. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
    - Open `emotion_detection.ipynb` in Google Colab.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required dependencies by running:
      ```sh
      !pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
      ```

4. **Upload Dataset**:
    - [Download the dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G36Lpdgq3ha1vbMcI4yOFLGNhVZ_6glG/view).
    - Upload the downloaded dataset to your Google Drive and mount it in the Colab notebook as shown in the code.


5. **Run the Notebook**:
    - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
